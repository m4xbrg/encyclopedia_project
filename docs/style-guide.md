# Encyclopedia Project Style Guide

## Explanation
- Use clear, precise language that is accessible to a broad audience.
- Organize content with descriptive headings and short paragraphs to aid navigation.
- Emphasize reproducibility by linking to source notebooks, data, or prior sections when relevant.
- Maintain consistent terminology; prefer "entry" over synonyms like "article" unless quoting sources.
- Follow standard Markdown conventions for lists, code fences, and block quotes.

## Example
```markdown
### Entry Structure
1. **Overview** — summarize the subject in two sentences.
2. **Historical Context** — highlight key milestones with dates.
3. **Current Relevance** — explain why the topic matters today.
4. **Further Reading** — include at least three references.
```
