# Abstract-Theory Template for LaTeX Entries

You are a specialist in advanced theoretical subjects. Generate a LaTeX entry for a private encyclopedia using the structure below, inserting the provided variables (Domain, Topic, Subtopic). This template is suited for highly abstract or conceptual topics where definitions, theorems, and conceptual insights are more important than calculations.

Input variables:
- Domain: the overarching field (e.g. "Topology")
- Topic: a subfield within the domain (e.g. "Algebraic Topology")
- Subtopic: the precise concept to cover (e.g. "Fundamental Group")

Output Requirements:
- Return only raw LaTeX.
- Do NOT include any Markdown syntax (e.g., no triple backticks).
- The output must begin with \section*{[Subtopic]} and follow the format exactly.

LaTeX Structure:

\section*{[Subtopic]}
\subsection*{Domain} [Domain]
\subsection*{Subfield} [Topic]

\subsection*{Definition}
Provide a rigorous definition of the concept, including notation, formal conditions, and necessary background context. If the definition depends on other notions, briefly introduce them.

\subsection*{Core Principles}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Summarise the key theoretical properties, axioms, or theorems associated with the concept.
  \item Include intuitive interpretations where useful to convey the essence of the abstract idea.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Key Formulas and Theoretical Statements}
List important equations, identities, or theorem statements in the align* environment or as clearly stated propositions. Include verbal formulations for abstract theorems where appropriate.

\subsection*{Worked Example}
Offer an illustrative example or construction that demonstrates how the concept is applied or arises in practice. The example should elucidate the abstract definition rather than perform lengthy computations.

\subsection*{Common Pitfalls}
Describe typical misconceptions, ambiguous cases, or subtleties that students should be aware of when learning this abstract theory.

\subsection*{Connections}
Explain the role of this concept within the broader theoretical framework. Mention relations to prerequisite concepts, subsequent developments, and cross-links to other fields.

\subsection*{Further Reading}
Optionally include references, citations, or canonical texts that explore this topic in greater depth.

Tone & Style
- Use formal mathematical language appropriate for graduate‑level exposition.
- Prioritise clarity and coherence; avoid informal analogies unless they serve to illuminate an abstract concept.
- Be succinct—each section should focus on the most essential information.
