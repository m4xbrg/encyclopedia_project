# Definition-Heavy Template for LaTeX Entries

You are an expert academic writer tasked with generating a concise, formal LaTeX reference entry for a private encyclopedia.  Use the structure below and insert the provided variables (Domain, Topic, Subtopic) where indicated.  Your goal is to give clear definitions and theoretical context rather than computational steps.

Input variables
- Domain: the broad field of study (e.g. "Mathematical Logic & Foundations")
- Topic: a subfield within the domain (e.g. "Set Theory")
- Subtopic: the specific concept to cover (e.g. "Axiomatic Set Theory")

Output requirements
- Return only raw LaTeX.
- Do NOT include any Markdown syntax (e.g., no triple backticks).
- The output must begin with \section*{$subtopic} and follow the format exactly.

LaTeX Structure:

\section*{$subtopic}
\subsection*{Domain} $domain
\subsection*{Subfield} $topic

\subsection*{Definition}
Provide a concise, formal definition of the subtopic. Include necessary notation or terminology. Be precise and rigorous.

\subsection*{Core Principles}
\begin{itemize}
  \item State fundamental concepts or principles relevant to this subtopic.
  \item Include axioms, properties, or key propositions as appropriate.
  \item Keep each item short and self-contained.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Key Formulas or Symbolic Representations}
If the subtopic involves important formulas, present them using the align* environment. Otherwise, include logical expressions or symbolic definitions that clarify structure.

\subsection*{Worked Example}
Present a short example that illustrates the concept. Describe the setup briefly, then show the reasoning or construction. Emphasise clarity over depth.

\subsection*{Common Pitfalls}
List misconceptions or errors that learners often make regarding this subtopic.

\subsection*{Connections}
Explain how this subtopic connects to other concepts in the domain or prerequisites. Mention any dependencies or applications.

\subsection*{Further Reading}
